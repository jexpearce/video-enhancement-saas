"""
Integration Example: Image Curation + Storage System

This example demonstrates how the new Storage System (Days 25-26) integrates 
with the existing Image Curation System (Days 23-24) to create a complete 
image processing pipeline.

Flow:
1. Curate images using ML (CLIP + quality assessment)
2. Store best images with multi-size processing 
3. Serve optimized images via CDN
